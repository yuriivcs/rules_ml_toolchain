"""Runtime library search directories feature.

This feature overrides the default runtime_library_search_directories behavior
to ensure proper with_features support for no_solib_rpaths.

The issue: The global hermetic toolchain embeds runtime_library_search_directories
flag_sets directly in action_config, which prevents Bazel from properly evaluating
with_features conditions like not_features = ["no_solib_rpaths"].

The fix: Create a standalone feature with the same flag_sets but as a proper feature,
so that with_features conditions are correctly evaluated.
